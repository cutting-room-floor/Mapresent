# Mapresent

Mapresent aims to be a geographic-focused presentation tool. The user will be able to present locations, themes, data, transitions, and voice narration on maps, then play the presentation on an external display or export and upload it to a video sharing service. 

Check out the announcement blog post: http://mapbox.com/blog/mapresent-presentation-tool-ipad/

The sort of thing you'd get out of this would be, say, a YouTube-uploaded HD video of a map presentation that goes like this:

 * Throughout, a voice track narrates the presentation.
 * Start with 3D view of the world, Blue Marble theme.
 * Points appear, animated, of major spots where US imports oil from.
 * Map zooms to 2D view of a particular region of focus, theme changing to a more World Light-like presentation theme, audio adds more context.
 * Map zooms back out to 3D Blue Marble, then in to US World Light, fading in Energy Dept. layer of alternative fueling stations nationwide.

Additionally, this app could, when used live instead of watched via exported video, have the audio track muted, with a live presenter instead, who can grab and adjust the intermediary points to explore or focus in more depth. At any point, the play button can be hit again and the next "waypoint" in the presentation is moved to, picking up where it left off before the interruption.
