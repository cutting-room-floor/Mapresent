# Mapresent

This is an iPad application idea to be fleshed & out developed here. 

### Overview

The elevator pitch is something along the lines of "An app for making and sharing stunning map presentations, live or video". It would be the sort of thing that you just can't do (at least not yet) with HTML, such as 3D globe transitions using something like Steve Gifford's [WhirlyGlobe](http://www.mousebirdconsulting.com/whirlyglobe) (see MBTiles work [here](http://code.google.com/p/whirlyglobe/issues/detail?id=1)) and native stuff like QuickTime export, audio recording, easily sharing tie-ins like system email & Twitter, and things we already think about like VGA/HDMI out.

The feel of the app would be very iOS-y -- something akin to GarageBand or iMovie -- something that you normally wouldn't think possible on a mobile device, but that focuses on touch first and primally. The whole of our MapBox tiles could be seen as "themes" for use when designing your presentation, not seen at the level of an API or dataset. Very visual.

The sort of thing you'd get out of this would be, say, a YouTube-uploaded HD video of a map presentation that goes like this:

 * Throughout, a voice track narrates the presentation.
 * Start with 3D view of the world, Blue Marble theme.
 * Points appear, animated, of major spots where US imports oil from.
 * Map zooms to 2D view of a particular region of focus, theme changing to a more World Light-like presentation theme, audio adds more context.
 * Map zooms back out to 3D Blue Marble, then in to US World Light, fading in Energy Dept. layer of alternative fueling stations nationwide.

Additionally, I had an idea with this inspired by a post last year about [ESRI's Killer Feature](http://kcurry.blogs.bridgeborn.com/esris-killer-feature/) -- presentation mode.

> What’s elegant is that the presentation is really just a series of view points of the map. That means the transition between presentation and the full compliment of data and features of the map is seamless. When I say “seamless” I mean entirely indistinguishable from one mode to the other. The presentation tool and the map are one and the same.

Similarly, this app could, when used live instead of watched via exported video, have the audio track muted, with a live presenter instead, who can grab and adjust the intermediary points to explore or focus in more depth. At any point, the play button can be hit again and the next "waypoint" in the presentation is moved to, picking up where it left off before the interruption.
